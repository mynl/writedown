## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-06

Initial scaffold — a running Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript desktop app baseline. No
editor features yet; this establishes the shell, build, icons, version plumbing, and
the developer-drive churn firewall so subsequent phases (spec §30) can climb from here.

### Added

- **Project docs**: `CLAUDE.md` (standing instructions), `README.md`, this changelog,
  `human-hints.md` (decision journal), `.gitignore`.
- **Tauri 2 app** (`src-tauri/`) + **React 19 / TypeScript / Vite** frontend (`src/`),
  identifier `com.mynl.writedown`, window titled "Writedown" (1200×800).
- **Three-pane shell** (Files · Editor · Outline) with a status-bar footer.
- **Version in the footer**, read at runtime via `@tauri-apps/api/app` `getVersion()` —
  single-sourced from `tauri.conf.json`, no hard-coded copy.
- **App icons** generated from `assets/writedown-logo.png` into `src-tauri/icons/`
  (Windows `.ico`, `Square*Logo`, macOS `.icns`, plus Android/iOS sets).
- **Churn firewall**: Rust `target/` and `node_modules/` routed to the `V:` dev drive
  (`src-tauri/.cargo/config.toml` + a node_modules junction); `scripts/dev-setup.ps1`
  re-establishes it after installs; npm cache on `V:`.

Frontend build (`tsc && vite build`) and backend (`cargo check`) both pass.
